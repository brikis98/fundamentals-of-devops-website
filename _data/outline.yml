      description: "At this very moment, somewhere in the world, two programmers are sitting in a garage and creating our future, one line of code at a time. We are in the era of the high tech startup. This book is the 'Hello, World' tutorial for building products, technologies, and teams in a startup environment. It's based on the experiences of the author, Yevgeniy Brikman, as well as interviews with programmers from some of the most successful startups of the last decade, including Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, Stripe, Instagram, AdMob, Pinterest, and many others. If you're at all interested in startups—whether you're a programmer at the beginning of your career, a seasoned developer bored with the politics of large companies, a manager trying to figure out how to motivate your engineers, or just someone trying to figure out what this startup thing is all about—this book is for you."

More than ever, the effective management of technology is critical for business competitiveness. For decades, technology leaders have struggled to balance agility, reliability, and security. The consequences of failure have never been greater--whether it's the healthcare.gov debacle, cardholder data breaches, or missing the boat with Big Data in the cloud. And yet, high performers using DevOps principles, such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, Etsy, and Netflix, are routinely and reliably deploying code into production hundreds, or even thousands, of times per day. Following in the footsteps of The Phoenix Project, The DevOps Handbook shows leaders how to replicate these incredible outcomes, by showing how to integrate Product Management, Development, QA, IT Operations, and Information Security to elevate your company and win in the marketplace."

Now with The Unicorn Project, Gene Kim introduces the Five Ideals.This highly anticipated follow-up to the bestselling title The Phoenix Project takes another look at Parts Unlimited, this time from the perspective of software development. In The Unicorn Project, we follow Maxine, a senior lead developer and architect, as she is exiled to the Phoenix Project, to the horror of her friends and colleagues, as punishment for contributing to a payroll outage. She tries to survive in what feels like a heartless and uncaring bureaucracy and to work within a system where no one can get anything done without endless committees, paperwork, and approvals.One day, she is approached by a ragtag bunch of misfits who say they want to overthrow the existing order, to liberate developers, to bring joy back to technology work, and to enable the business to win in a time of digital disruption. To her surprise, she finds herself drawn ever further into this movement, eventually becoming one of the leaders of the Rebellion, which puts her in the crosshairs of some familiar and very dangerous enemies.The Age of Software is here, and another mass extinction event looms―this is a story about “red shirt” developers and business leaders working together, racing against time to innovate, survive, and thrive in a time of unprecedented uncertainty...and opportunity."

Leading-edge companies like Amazon and Google are applying DevOps and Agile principles to deliver large software projects faster than anyone thought possible. But most executives don't understand how to transform their current legacy systems and processes to scale these principles across their organizations. Leading the Transformation is an executive guide, providing a clear framework for improving development and delivery. Instead of the traditional Agile and DevOps approaches that focus on improving the effectiveness of teams, this book targets the coordination of work across teams in large organizations -- an improvement that executives are uniquely positioned to lead."

Adopting Lean will take time and commitment, but it’s vital for harnessing the cultural and technical forces that are accelerating the rate of innovation."

Google revealed the secret through a project called Kubernetes, an open source cluster orchestrator (based on its internal Borg system) that radically simplifies the task of building, deploying, and maintaining scalable distributed systems in the cloud. This practical guide shows you how Kubernetes and container technology can help you achieve new levels of velocity, agility, reliability, and efficiency. Authors Kelsey Hightower, Brendan Burns, and Joe Beda—who’ve worked on Kubernetes at Google and other organizatons—explain how this system fits into the lifecycle of a distributed application. You will learn how to use tools and APIs to automate scalable distributed systems, whether it is for online services, machine-learning applications, or a cluster of Raspberry Pi computers."

      description: "Kubernetes has become the dominant container orchestrator, but many organizations that have recently adopted this system are still struggling to run actual production workloads. In this practical book, four software engineers from VMware bring their shared experiences running Kubernetes in production and provide insight on key challenges and best practices. The brilliance of Kubernetes is how configurable and extensible the system is, from pluggable runtimes to storage integrations. For platform engineers, software developers, infosec, network engineers, storage engineers, and others, this book examines how the path to success with Kubernetes involves a variety of technology, pattern, and abstraction considerations. With this book, you"

      description: "Test-Driven Development (TDD) is now an established technique for delivering better software faster. TDD is based on a simple idea: Write tests for your code before you write the code itself. However, this 'simple' idea takes skill and judgment to do well. Now there's a practical guide to TDD that takes you beyond the basic concepts. Drawing on a decade of experience building real-world systems, two TDD pioneers show how to let tests guide your development and 'grow' software that is coherent, reliable, and maintainable. Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce describe the processes they use, the design principles they strive to achieve, and some of the tools that help them get the job done. Through an extended worked example, you’ll learn how TDD works at multiple levels, using tests to drive the features and the object-oriented structure of the code, and using Mock Objects to discover and then describe relationships between objects. Along the way, the book systematically addresses challenges that development teams encounter with TDD--from integrating TDD into your processes to testing your most difficult features."

      description: "This book provides programmers with the ability to cost effectively handle common legacy code problems without having to go through the hugely expensive task of rewriting all existing code. It describes a series of practical strategies that developers can employ to bring their existing software applications under control. The author provides useful guidance about how to use these strategies when refactoring or making functional changes to codebases. One of the book's key points is that it teaches developers to write tests that can be used to make sure they are not unintentionally changing the application as they optimize it. Examples are provided in Java, C++, and C sharp,and the book assumes that the reader has some knowledge of UML notation. Strategies using UML and code in C++ and Java primarily while language independent advice will be delivered in side bars and appendices for language specific users."

A VCS is a central part of every modern software delivery process, and yet, I still frequently come across developers who don’t know how or why to use version control. If you’re one of these developers, it’s nothing to be ashamed of, and you’ll find that if you take a small amount of time to learn it now, it’s one of those skills that will benefit you for years to come. This tutorial will teach you the basics of how to use two of the most popular version control tools available today, Git and GitHub, through a series of hands-on exercises that take about 15 minutes."

      description: "Winner of the 2011 Jolt Excellence Award! Getting software released to users is often a painful, risky, and time-consuming process. This groundbreaking new book sets out the principles and technical practices that enable rapid, incremental delivery of high quality, valuable new functionality to users. Through automation of the build, deployment, and testing process, and improved collaboration between developers, testers, and operations, delivery teams can get changes released in a matter of hours—sometimes even minutes–no matter what the size of a project or the complexity of its code base. Jez Humble and David Farley begin by presenting the foundations of a rapid, reliable, low-risk delivery process. Next, they introduce the “deployment pipeline,” an automated process for managing all changes, from check-in to release. Finally, they discuss the “ecosystem” needed tosupport continuous delivery, from infrastructure, data and configuration management to governance. The authors introduce state-of-the-art techniques, including automated infrastructure management and data migration, and the use of virtualization. For each, they review key issues, identify best practices, and demonstrate how to mitigate risks."

Are you ready for a world filled with flakey networks, tangled databases, and impatient users? If you're a developer and don't want to be on call for 3AM for the rest of your life, this book will help. In Release It!, Michael T. Nygard shows you how to design and architect your application for the harsh realities it will face. You'll learn how to design your application for maximum uptime, performance, and return on investment. Mike explains that many problems with systems today start with the design."

      description: "At Gruntwork, I've had the chance to see the cloud adoption journeys of hundreds of companies, from tiny startups to Fortune 50 giants. I've seen those journeys go well. I've seen those journeys go poorly. In this talk, I discuss a few of the ways cloud adoption can go horribly wrong (massive cost overruns, endless death marches, security disasters), and more importantly, how you can get it right. To help you get it right, we looked at the cloud journeys that were successful and extracted from them the patterns they had in common. We distilled all this experience down into something called the Gruntwork Production Framework, which defines five concrete steps you can follow to adopt the cloud at your own company—and hopefully, to end up with your very own happy cloud deployment."

      description: "By default, OpenTofu and Terraform  record information about what infrastructure they created in a state file on your local file system called terraform.tfstate. For personal projects, this works just fine, but for professional projects with a team, you need a way to manage state that supports collaboration, locking, encryption, and multiple environments. A few years ago, I wrote a guide to managing state with Terraform and managing multiple environments with Terraform. Since then,OpenTofu has added several important features that provide new ways to solve these problems. This blog post is a tutorial on how to manage state and environments with OpenTofu in a way that is more secure and more convenient than what you can do with Terraform."

That branch is going to be colloquially known as trunk, perhaps even named “trunk”. Devs may, on their own dev workstations, do some multi-branch development (say with Git), but when they are “done” with a change or a bug fix, it should go back to the shared trunk. It is not “done” if it is not there - watch for that little lie of omission."

Eventually the development team ends up in what is known as monolithic hell. All aspects of software development and deployment become painfully slow. The solution is to adopt the microservice architecture, which structures an application as a services, organized around business capabilities. This architecture accelerates software development and enables continuous delivery and deployment of complex software applications. Microservice Patterns teaches enterprise developers and architects how to build applications with the microservice architecture. Rather than simply advocating for the use the microservice architecture, this clearly-written guide takes a balanced, pragmatic approach. You'll discover that the microservice architecture is not a silver bullet and has both benefits and drawbacks. Along the way, you'll learn a pattern language that will enable you to solve the issues that arise when using the microservice architecture. This book also teaches you how to refactor a monolithic application to a microservice architecture."

It begins with the basics of networks and networking, examines network analysis with Wireshark and tcpdump, offers one of the most complete and in-depth analyses of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth networks, then progresses through the various protocols such as DNS, ARP, SMTP, and others. The reader will be led through the building of those applications in Linux, such as an EXIM server for email or a BIND server for DNS. Then OTW leads the reader through the major vulnerabilities of that protocol/application. In the final chapters, OTW leads the reader through some of the networks on the leading-edge of cybersecurity, such as Car, Radio, and Industrial networks.

Hosts behind the firewall have no defenses of their own, so when a host in the 'trusted' zone is breached, access to your data center is not far behind. This practical book introduces you to the zero trust model, a method that treats all hosts as if they’re internet-facing, and considers the entire network to be compromised and hostile. Authors Evan Gilman and Doug Barth show you how zero trust lets you focus on building strong authentication, authorization, and encryption throughout, while providing compartmentalized access and better operational agility. You’ll learn the architecture of a zero trust network, including how to build one using currently available technology."

      description: "There’s an old saying in information security: “We want our network to be like an M&M, with a hard crunchy outside and a soft chewy center.” For a generation of information security professionals, this was the motto we grew up with. It was a motto based on trust and the assumption that malicious individuals wouldn’t get past the “hard crunchy outside.” In today’s new threat landscape, this is no longer an effective way of enforcing security. Once an attacker gets past the shell, he has access to all the resources in our network. We’ve built strong perimeters, but well-organized cybercriminals have recruited insiders and developed new attack methods that easily pierce our current security protections. To confront these new threats, information security professionals must eliminate the soft chewy center by making security ubiquitous throughout the network, not just at the perimeter. To help security professionals do this effectively, Forrester has developed a new model for information security, called Zero Trust. This report, the first in a series, will introduce the necessity and key concepts of the Zero Trust Model."

      description: "Can a system be considered truly reliable if it isn't fundamentally secure? Or can it be considered secure if it's unreliable? Security is crucial to the design and operation of scalable systems in production, as it plays an important part in product quality, performance, and availability. In this book, experts from Google share best practices to help your organization design scalable and reliable systems that are fundamentally secure. Two previous O’Reilly books from Google―Site Reliability Engineering and The Site Reliability Workbook―demonstrated how and why a commitment to the entire service lifecycle enables organizations to successfully build, deploy, monitor, and maintain software systems. In this latest guide, the authors offer insights into system design, implementation, and maintenance from practitioners who specialize in security and reliability. They also discuss how building and adopting their recommended best practices requires a culture that’s supportive of such change."

But how do you know if the deployment is secure? This practical book examines key underlying technologies to help developers, operators, and security professionals assess security risks and determine appropriate solutions. Author Liz Rice, Chief Open Source Officer at Isovalent, looks at how the building blocks commonly used in container-based systems are constructed in Linux. You'll understand what's happening when you deploy containers and learn how to assess potential security risks that could affect your deployments. If you run container applications with kubectl or docker and use Linux command-line tools such as ps and grep, you're ready to get started."

      description: "Data is getting bigger and more complex by the day, and so are the choices in handling that data. As a modern application developer you need to understand the emerging field of data management, both RDBMS and NoSQL. Seven Databases in Seven Weeks takes you on a tour of some of the hottest open source databases today. In the tradition of Bruce A. Tate's Seven Languages in Seven Weeks , this book goes beyond your basic tutorial to explore the essential concepts at the core each technology.Redis, Neo4J, CouchDB, MongoDB, HBase, Riak and Postgres. With each database, you'll tackle a real-world data problem that highlights the concepts and features that make it shine. You'll explore the five data models employed by these databases-relational, key/value, columnar, document and graph-and which kinds of problems are best suited to each.You'll learn how MongoDB and CouchDB are strikingly different, and discover the Dynamo heritage at the heart of Riak. Make your applications faster with Redis and more connected with Neo4J. Use MapReduce to solve Big Data problems. Build clusters of servers using scalable services like Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).Discover the CAP theorem and its implications for your distributed data. Understand the tradeoffs between consistency and availability, and when you can use them to your advantage. Use multiple databases in concert to create a platform that's more than the sum of its parts, or find one that meets all your needs at once.Seven Databases in Seven Weeks will take you on a deep dive into each of the databases, their strengths and weaknesses, and how to choose the ones that fit your needs.What You To get the most of of this book you'll have to follow along, and that means you'll need a *nix shell (Mac OSX or Linux preferred, Windows users will need Cygwin), and Java 6 (or greater) and Ruby 1.8.7 (or greater). Each chapter will list the downloads required for that database."

      description: "Bigtable is a distributed storage system for managing structured data that is designed to scale to a very large size: petabytes of data across thousands of commodity servers. Many projects at Google store data in Bigtable, including web indexing, Google Earth, and Google Finance. These applications place very different demands on Bigtable, both in terms of data size (from URLs to web pages to satellite imagery) and latency requirements (from backend bulk processing to real-time data serving). Despite these varied demands, Bigtable has successfully provided a flexible, high-performance solution for all of these Google products. In this paper we describe the simple data model provided by Bigtable, which gives clients dynamic control over data layout and format, and we describe the design and implementation of Bigtable."

      description: "Until recently, infrastructure was the backbone of organizations operating software they developed in-house. But now that cloud vendors run the computers, companies can finally bring the benefits of agile custom-centricity to their own developers. Adding product management to infrastructure organizations is now all the rage. But how's that possible when infrastructure is still the operational layer of the company? This practical book guides engineers, managers, product managers, and leaders through the shifts that modern platform-led organizations require. You'll learn what platform engineering is—and isn't—and what benefits and value it brings to developers and teams. You'll understand what it means to approach a platform as a product and learn some of the most common technical and managerial barriers to success."

      description: "Trillions of lines of code help us in our lives, companies, and organizations. But just a single software cybersecurity vulnerability can stop entire companies from doing business and cause billions of dollars in revenue loss and business recovery. Securing the creation and deployment of software, also known as software supply chain security, goes well beyond the software development process. This practical book gives you a comprehensive look at security risks and identifies the practical controls you need to incorporate into your end-to-end software supply chain. Author Cassie Crossley demonstrates how and why everyone involved in the supply chain needs to participate if your organization is to improve the security posture of its software, firmware, and hardware."
