      description: "'This remarkable book combines practical advice, ready-to-use techniques, and a deep understanding of why this is the right way to develop software. I have seen software teams transformed by the ideas in this book.' --Mike Cohn, author of Agile Estimating and Planning 'As a lean practitioner myself, I have loved and used their first book for years. When this second book came out, I was delighted that it was even better. If you are interested in how lean principles can be useful for software development organizations, this is the book you are looking for. The Poppendiecks offer a beautiful blend of history, theory, and practice.' --Alan Shalloway, coauthor of Design Patterns Explained 'I've enjoyed reading the book very much. I feel it might even be better than the first lean book by Tom and Mary, while that one was already exceptionally good! Mary especially has a lot of knowledge related to lean techniques in product development and manufacturing. It's rare that these techniques are actually translated into software. This is something no other book does well(except their first book).' --Bas Vodde 'The new book by Mary and Tom Poppendieck provides a well-written and comprehensive introduction to lean principles and selected practices for software managers and engineers. It illustrates the application of the values and practices with well-suited success stories. I enjoyed reading it.' --Roman Pichler ' In Implementing Lean Software Development, the Poppendiecks explore more deeply the themes they introduced in Lean Software Development. They begin with a compelling history of lean thinking, then move to key areas such as value, waste, and people. Each chapter includes exercises to help you apply key points. If you want a better understanding of how lean ideas can work with software, this book is for you.' --Bill Wake, independent consultant In 2003, Mary and Tom Poppendieck's Lean Software Development introduced breakthrough development techniques that leverage Lean principles to deliver unprecedented agility and value. Now their widely anticipated sequel and companion guide shows exactly how to implement Lean software development, hands-on. This new book draws on the Poppendiecks' unparalleled experience helping development organizations optimize the entire software value stream. You'll discover the right questions to ask, the key issues to focus on, and techniques proven to work. The authors present case studies from leading-edge software organizations and offer practical exercises for jumpstarting your own Lean initiatives. Implementing Lean Software Development is indispensable to anyone who wants more effective development processes--managers, project leaders, senior developers, and architects in enterprise IT and software companies alike."

The consequences of failure have never been greater--whether it's the healthcare.gov debacle, cardholder data breaches, or missing the boat with Big Data in the cloud. And yet, high performers using DevOps principles, such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, Etsy, and Netflix, are routinely and reliably deploying code into production hundreds, or even thousands, of times per day. Following in the footsteps of The Phoenix Project, The DevOps Handbook shows leaders how to replicate these incredible outcomes, by showing how to integrate Product Management, Development, QA, IT Operations, and Information Security to elevate your company and win in the marketplace'--"

    - title: "Visible Ops Handbook"
      image: "assets/img/books/visible-ops-handbook.jpg"
      description: "The Core of Visible Ops Visible Ops is a methodology designed to jumpstart implementation of controls and process improvement in IT organizations needing to increase service levels, security, and auditability while managing costs. Visible Ops is comprised of four prescriptive and self-fueling steps that take an organization from any starting point to a continually improving process. Making ITIL Actionable Although the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) provides a wealth of best practices, it lacks prescriptive guidance: What do you implement first, and how do you do it? Moreover, the ITIL books remain relatively expensive to distribute. Other information, publicly available from a variety of sources, is too general and vague to effectively aid organizations that need to start or enhance process improvement efforts. The Visible Ops booklet provides a prescriptive roadmap for organizations beginning or continuing their IT process improvement journey. Why Do You Need Visible Ops? The Visible Ops methodology was developed because there was not a satisfactory answer to the question: “I believe in the need for IT process improvement, but where do I start?” Since 2000, Gene Kim and Kevin Behr have met with hundreds of IT organizations and identified eight high-performing IT organizations with the highest service levels, best security, and best efficiencies. For years, they studied these high-performing organizations to figure out the secrets to their success. Visible Ops codifies how these organizations achieved their transformation from good to great, showing how interested organizations can replicate the key processes of these high-performing organizations in just four steps: 1. Stabilize Patient, Modify First Response – Almost 80% of outages are self-inflicted. The first step is to control risky changes and reduce MTTR by addressing how changes are managed and how problems are resolved. 2. Catch and Release, Find Fragile Artifacts – Often, infrastructure exists that cannot be repeatedly replicated. In this step, we inventory assets, configurations and services, to identify those with the lowest change success rates, highest MTTR and highest business downtime costs. 3. Establish Repeatable Build Library – The highest return on investment is implementing effective release management processes. This step creates repeatable builds for the most critical assets and services, to make it “cheaper to rebuild than to repair.” 4. Enable Continuous Improvement – The previous steps have progressively built a closed-loop between the Release, Control and Resolution processes. This step implements metrics to allow continuous improvement of all of these process areas, to best ensure that business objectives are met."

Now with The Unicorn Project, Gene Kim introduces the Five Ideals.This highly anticipated follow-up to the bestselling title The Phoenix Project takes another look at Parts Unlimited, this time from the perspective of software development. In The Unicorn Project, we follow Maxine, a senior lead developer and architect, as she is exiled to the Phoenix Project, to the horror of her friends and colleagues, as punishment for contributing to a payroll outage. She tries to survive in what feels like a heartless and uncaring bureaucracy and to work within a system where no one can get anything done without endless committees, paperwork, and approvals.One day, she is approached by a ragtag bunch of misfits who say they want to overthrow the existing order, to liberate developers, to bring joy back to technology work, and to enable the business to win in a time of digital disruption. To her surprise, she finds herself drawn ever further into this movement, eventually becoming one of the leaders of the Rebellion, which puts her in the crosshairs of some familiar and very dangerous enemies.The Age of Software is here, and another mass extinction event looms―this is a story about “red shirt” developers and business leaders working together, racing against time to innovate, survive, and thrive in a time of unprecedented uncertainty...and opportunity."

      description: "Cloud native infrastructure is more than servers, network, and storage in the cloud—it is as much about operational hygiene as it is about elasticity and scalability. In this book, you’ll learn practices, patterns, and requirements for creating infrastructure that meets your needs, capable of managing the full life cycle of cloud native applications. Justin Garrison and Kris Nova reveal hard-earned lessons on architecting infrastructure from companies such as Google, Amazon, and Netflix. They draw inspiration from projects adopted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), and provide examples of patterns seen in existing tools such as Kubernetes."

      description: "Test-Driven Development (TDD) is now an established technique for delivering better software faster. TDD is based on a simple idea: Write tests for your code before you write the code itself. However, this 'simple' idea takes skill and judgment to do well. Now there's a practical guide to TDD that takes you beyond the basic concepts. Drawing on a decade of experience building real-world systems, two TDD pioneers show how to let tests guide your development and 'grow' software that is coherent, reliable, and maintainable. Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce describe the processes they use, the design principles they strive to achieve, and some of the tools that help them get the job done. Through an extended worked example, you’ll learn how TDD works at multiple levels, using tests to drive the features and the object-oriented structure of the code, and using Mock Objects to discover and then describe relationships between objects. Along the way, the book systematically addresses challenges that development teams encounter with TDD--from integrating TDD into your processes to testing your most difficult features."

It describes a series of practical strategies that developers can employ to bring their existing software applications under control. The author provides useful guidance about how to use these strategies when refactoring or making functional changes to codebases. One of the book's key points is that it teaches developers to write tests that can be used to make sure they are not unintentionally changing the application as they optimize it. Examples are provided in Java, C++, and C sharp,and the book assumes that the reader has some knowledge of UML notation. Strategies using UML and code in C++ and Java primarily while language independent advice will be delivered in side bars and appendices for language specific users."

Git has come a long way since it was first developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development. It has taken the open source world by storm since its inception in 2005, and this book teaches you how to use it like a pro. Effective and well-implemented version control is a necessity for successful web projects, whether large or small. With this book you’ll learn how to master the world of distributed version workflow, use the distributed features of Git to the full, and extend Git to meet your every need."

      description: "A version control system (VCS) is a tool that allows you to store source code, share it with your team, integrateyour work together, and track changes over time. A VCS is a central part of every modern software delivery process, and yet, I still frequently come across developers who don’t know how or why to use version control. If you’re one of these developers, it’s nothing to be ashamed of, and you’ll find that if you take a small amount of time to learn it now, it’s one of those skills that will benefit you for years to come. This tutorial will teach you the basics of how to use two of the most popular version control tools available today, Git and GitHub, through a series of hands-on exercises that take about 15 minutes."

Getting software released to users is often a painful, risky, and time-consuming process.This groundbreaking new book sets out the principles and technical practices that enablerapid, incremental delivery of high quality, valuable new functionality to users. Throughautomation of the build, deployment, and testing process, and improved collaboration betweendevelopers, testers, and operations, delivery teams can get changes released in a matter of hours—sometimes even minutes–no matter what the size of a project or the complexity of its code base. Jez Humble and David Farley begin by presenting the foundations of a rapid, reliable, low-riskdelivery process. Next, they introduce the “deployment pipeline,” an automated process formanaging all changes, from check-in to release. Finally, they discuss the “ecosystem” needed tosupport continuous delivery, from infrastructure, data and configuration management to governance. The authors introduce state-of-the-art techniques, including automated infrastructure managementand data migration, and the use of virtualization. For each, they review key issues, identify bestpractices, and demonstrate how to mitigate risks. Coverage includes • Automating all facets of building, integrating, testing, and deploying software• Implementing deployment pipelines at team and organizational levels• Improving collaboration between developers, testers, and operations• Developing features incrementally on large and distributed teams• Implementing an effective configuration management strategy• Automating acceptance testing, from analysis to implementation• Testing capacity and other non-functional requirements• Implementing continuous deployment and zero-downtime releases• Managing infrastructure, data, components and dependencies• Navigating risk management, compliance, and auditing Whether you’re a developer, systems administrator, tester, or manager, this book will help yourorganization move from idea to release faster than ever—so you can deliver value to your businessrapidly and reliably. "

For personal projects, this works just fine, but for professional projects with a team, you need a way to manage state that supports collaboration, locking, encryption, and multiple environments. A few years ago, I wrote a guide to managing state with Terraform and managing multiple environments with Terraform. Since then,OpenTofu has added several important features that provide new ways to solve these problems. This blog post is a tutorial on how to manage state and environments with OpenTofu in a way that is more secure and more convenient than what you can do with Terraform.

After splitting a monolithic application or building a microservice ecosystem from scratch, many engineers are left wondering what s next. In this practical book, author Susan Fowler presents a set of microservice standards in depth, drawing from her experience standardizing over a thousand microservices at Uber. You ll learn how to design microservices that are stable, reliable, scalable, fault tolerant, performant, monitored, documented, and prepared for any catastrophe.Explore production-readiness standards, including:Stability and Reliability:  develop, deploy, introduce, and deprecate microservices; protect against dependency failuresScalability and Performance:  learn essential components for achieving greater microservice efficiencyFault Tolerance and Catastrophe Preparedness:  ensure availability by actively pushing microservices to fail in real timeMonitoring:  learn how to monitor, log, and display key metrics; establish alerting and on-call proceduresDocumentation and Understanding:  mitigate tradeoffs that come with microservice adoption, including organizational sprawl and technical debt'"

      description: "The monolithic architecture works well for small, simple applications. However, successful applications have a habit of growing. Eventually the development team ends up in what is known as monolithic hell. All aspects of software development and deployment become painfully slow. The solution is to adopt the microservice architecture, which structures an application as a services, organized around business capabilities. This architecture accelerates software development and enables continuous delivery and deployment of complex software applications. Microservice Patterns teaches enterprise developers and architects how to build applications with the microservice architecture. Rather than simply advocating for the use the microservice architecture, this clearly-written guide takes a balanced, pragmatic approach. You'll discover that the microservice architecture is not a silver bullet and has both benefits and drawbacks. Along the way, you'll learn a pattern language that will enable you to solve the issues that arise when using the microservice architecture. This book also teaches you how to refactor a monolithic application to a microservice architecture."

Hosts behind the firewall have no defenses of their own, so when a host in the 'trusted' zone is breached, access to your data center is not far behind. This practical book introduces you to the zero trust model, a method that treats all hosts as if they’re internet-facing, and considers the entire network to be compromised and hostile. Authors Evan Gilman and Doug Barth show you how zero trust lets you focus on building strong authentication, authorization, and encryption throughout, while providing compartmentalized access and better operational agility. You’ll learn the architecture of a zero trust network, including how to build one using currently available technology."

    - title: "No More Chewy Centers: Introducing The Zero Trust Model Of Information Security"
      description: "There’s an old saying in information security: “We want our network to be like an M&M, with a hard crunchy outside and a soft chewy center.” For a generation of information security professionals, this was the motto we grew up with. It was a motto based on trust and the assumption that malicious individuals wouldn’t get past the “hard crunchy outside.” In today’s new threat landscape, this is no longer an effective way of enforcing security. Once an attacker gets past the shell, he has access to all the resources in our network. We’ve built strong perimeters, but well-organized cybercriminals have recruited insiders and developed new attack methods that easily pierce our current security protections. To confront these new threats, information security professionals must eliminate the soft chewy center by making security ubiquitous throughout the network, not just at the perimeter. To help security professionals do this effectively, Forrester has developed a new model for information security, called Zero Trust. This report, the first in a series, will introduce the necessity and key concepts of the Zero Trust Model."

As a modern application developer you need to understand the emerging field of data management, both RDBMS and NoSQL. Seven Databases in Seven Weeks takes you on a tour of some of the hottest open source databases today. In the tradition of Bruce A. Tate's Seven Languages in Seven Weeks , this book goes beyond your basic tutorial to explore the essential concepts at the core each technology.Redis, Neo4J, CouchDB, MongoDB, HBase, Riak and Postgres. With each database, you'll tackle a real-world data problem that highlights the concepts and features that make it shine. You'll explore the five data models employed by these databases-relational, key/value, columnar, document and graph-and which kinds of problems are best suited to each.You'll learn how MongoDB and CouchDB are strikingly different, and discover the Dynamo heritage at the heart of Riak. Make your applications faster with Redis and more connected with Neo4J. Use MapReduce to solve Big Data problems. Build clusters of servers using scalable services like Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).Discover the CAP theorem and its implications for your distributed data. Understand the tradeoffs between consistency and availability, and when you can use them to your advantage. Use multiple databases in concert to create a platform that's more than the sum of its parts, or find one that meets all your needs at once.Seven Databases in Seven Weeks will take you on a deep dive into each of the databases, their strengths and weaknesses, and how to choose the ones that fit your needs.What You To get the most of of this book you'll have to follow along, and that means you'll need a *nix shell (Mac OSX or Linux preferred, Windows users will need Cygwin), and Java 6 (or greater) and Ruby 1.8.7 (or greater). Each chapter will list the downloads required for that database."

      description: "Bigtable is a distributed storage system for managing structured data that is designed to scale to a very large size: petabytes of data across thousands of commodity servers. Many projects at Google store data in Bigtable, including web indexing, Google Earth, and Google Finance. These applications place very different demands on Bigtable, both in terms of data size (from URLs to web pages to satellite imagery) and latency requirements (from backend bulk processing to real-time data serving). Despite these varied demands, Bigtable has successfully provided a flexible, high-performance solution for all of these Google products. In this paper we describe the simple data model provided by Bigtable, which gives clients dynamic control over data layout and format, and we describe the design and implementation of Bigtable."

      description: "This paper presents the design and implementation of Dynamo, a highly available key-value storage system that some of Amazon’s core services use to provide an “always-on” experience. To achieve this level of availability, Dynamo sacrifices consistency under certain failure scenarios. It makes extensive use of object versioning and application-assisted conflict resolution in a manner that provides a novel interface for developers to use."

Douglas Hubbard helps us create a path to know the answer to almost any question in business, in science, or in life . . . Hubbard helps us by showing us that when we seek metrics to solve problems, we are really trying to know something better than we know it now. How to Measure Anything provides just the tools most of us need to measure anything better, to gain that insight, to make progress, and to succeed.'-Peter Tippett, PhD, M.D.Chief Technology Officer at CyberTrustand inventor of the first antivirus software'Doug Hubbard has provided an easy-to-read, demystifying explanation of how managers can inform themselves to make less risky, more profitable business decisions. We encourage our clients to try his powerful, practical techniques.'-Peter SchayEVP and COO ofThe Advisory Council'As a reader you soon realize that actually everything can be measured while learning how to measure only what matters. This book cuts through conventional clichés and business rhetoric and offers practical steps to using measurements as a tool for better decision making. Hubbard bridges the gaps to make college statistics relevant and valuable for business decisions.'-Ray GilbertEVP Lucent'This book is remarkable in its range of measurement applications and its clarity of style. A must-read for every professional who has ever exclaimed, 'Sure, that concept is important, but can we measure it?''-Dr. Jack StennerCofounder and CEO of MetraMetrics, Inc."

      description: "Until recently, infrastructure was the backbone of organizations operating software they developed in-house. But now that cloud vendors run the computers, companies can finally bring the benefits of agile custom-centricity to their own developers. Adding product management to infrastructure organizations is now all the rage.But how's that possible when infrastructure is still the operational layer of the company?This practical book guides engineers, managers, product managers, and leaders through the shifts that modern platform-led organizations require. You'll learn what platform engineering is—and isn't—and what benefits and value it brings to developers and teams. You'll understand what it means to approach a platform as a product and learn some of the most common technical and managerial barriers to success.With this book, you'Cultivate a platform-as-product, developer-centric mindsetLearn what platform engineering teams are and are notStart the process of adopting platform engineering within your organizationDiscover what it takes to become a product manager for a platform teamUnderstand the challenges that emerge when you scale platformsAutomate processes and self-service infrastructure to speed development and improve developer experienceBuild out, hire, manage, and advocate for a platform team"

      description: "Trillions of lines of code help us in our lives, companies, and organizations. But just a single software cybersecurity vulnerability can stop entire companies from doing business and cause billions of dollars in revenue loss and business recovery. Securing the creation and deployment of software, also known as software supply chain security, goes well beyond the software development process.This practical book gives you a comprehensive look at security risks and identifies the practical controls you need to incorporate into your end-to-end software supply chain. Author Cassie Crossley demonstrates how and why everyone involved in the supply chain needs to participate if your organization is to improve the security posture of its software, firmware, and hardware.With this book, you'll learn how Pinpoint the cybersecurity risks in each part of your organization's software supply chainIdentify the roles that participate in the supply chain—including IT, development, operations, manufacturing, and procurementDesign initiatives and controls for each part of the supply chain using existing frameworks and referencesImplement secure development lifecycle, source code security, software build management, and software transparency practicesEvaluate third-party risk in your supply chain"
