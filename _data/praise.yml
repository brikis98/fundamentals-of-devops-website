    I'm not aware of any other book that provides such practical advice on operations and systems administration in the
    context of delivering and running software. Jim's book stays refreshingly focused on the real-world aspects of
    DevOps—what most people actually mean when they use the term—rather than the theory.

    Meticulously organized, chock full of examples, buoyed by research and practical experience,
    <em>Fundamentals of DevOps and Software Delivery</em> is another outstanding project from the prolific Yevgeniy
    “Jim” Brikman. The breadth of technology in this space can feel overwhelming, but Jim manages to isolate the signal
    from the noise, emphasizing the prevailing industry best practices while smartly identifying pitfalls along the way.
