        There are many guides out there on how to write software. This book is a guide to <strong>software
        delivery</strong>: that is, all the processes, tools, and techniques that are required to run software in
        production and maintain it on an ongoing basis. In particular, this book is a guide to <strong>DevOps</strong>,
        one of the methodologies used today to make software delivery vastly more efficient.
      </p>
      <p class="justify thin">
        Whereas most DevOps content tends to focus primarily on culture and theory, this book is a
        <strong>hands-on guide</strong> that includes dozens of examples that walk you, step-by-step, through how to
        run real systems and real code. You’ll start with the basics—running a single server—and work all the way up to
        Kubernetes clusters, automated deployment pipelines, distributed data systems, and more.
      </p>
      <p class="justify thin">
        By the time you’re done with the book, you will have had hands-on practice with all the core
        concepts and best practices of modern DevOps and software delivery.
